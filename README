Most of the company logos can be created with CSS , CSS gives an artist a new arena to experiment with.

I made my own logo, along with experimenting on few things with HTML5 and CSS3 and tried to make a web page that could 
reflect an artist's blog.

With each attempt at making a web-site -i am trying to learn from my mistakes. Each mistake is teaching me new stuff that i 
could never learn from the books.
